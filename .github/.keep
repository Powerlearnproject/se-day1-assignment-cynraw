Developers work with stakeholders to understand what the software needs to do. This phase outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, which serve as the foundation for design and development.

Design:
The system architecture is designed, including how the software will be structured and what technologies will be used. This blueprint guides the development process.

Development:
Programmers write the actual code based on the design specifications. The software’s features and functionality are implemented in this phase.

Testing:
The software is tested to find and fix any bugs or issues. This ensures the product meets the requirements and functions properly in different environments.

Deployment:
After testing, the software is released to users. This may involve installing it on devices, configuring settings, or making it available online.

Maintenance:
Once deployed, the software needs ongoing updates, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback and evolving requirements. This phase ensures the software remains functional and up-to-date.


QUESTION 4
Waterfall Methodology:
Linear and Sequential: Waterfall follows a step-by-step process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Rigid: Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is complete.
Documentation-Focused: Heavy emphasis on detailed documentation before and during development.
Best for: Projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes (e.g., building a traditional banking system where requirements are clear and stable).

Agile Methodology:
Iterative and Flexible: Agile breaks projects into small, manageable cycles (sprints), allowing continuous feedback and adjustments.
Adaptable: Teams can quickly respond to changing requirements or customer feedback during the development process.
Collaboration-Focused: Encourages frequent interaction between developers, customers, and stakeholders.
Best for: Projects where requirements may evolve (e.g., developing a mobile app with frequent feature updates based on user feedback).

Project Manager:
Role: Oversees the software project, ensuring it is completed on time and within budget.
Responsibilities:
Plans and organizes the project timeline and resources.
Communicates with stakeholders and manages expectations.
Ensures the team meets deadlines and handles any issues that arise.


QUESTION 6
Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):

Efficiency: IDEs provide all the tools developers need in one place—code editor, debugger, compiler, and more—making development faster and smoother.
Error Detection: They offer features like syntax highlighting, error checking, and code suggestions, helping developers write better code and fix issues early.
Productivity: IDEs help automate repetitive tasks and offer shortcuts, boosting developer productivity.

Example:
Visual Studio Code: A popular, lightweight IDE for multiple programming languages.
IntelliJ IDEA: A powerful IDE for Java development.

Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS):

Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
History Tracking: It keeps a history of changes made to the codebase, making it easy to track and revert to previous versions when necessary.
Backup and Recovery: VCS ensures code is backed up, providing safety against accidental loss or errors.

Example:
Git: A widely used distributed version control system, often paired with GitHub for collaboration.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized VCS used in some organizations for version tracking and collaboration.


QUESTION 7 
Complex Problem-Solving:
Challenge: Tackling difficult technical problems or dealing with unclear requirements can be overwhelming.
Strategy: Break problems into smaller, manageable parts and collaborate with teammates or mentors for fresh perspectives.

Changing Requirements:
Challenge: Client or business needs may shift, requiring changes to the software mid-development.
Strategy: Use Agile methodologies to incorporate flexibility and ensure regular communication with stakeholders for better alignment.

Debugging and Fixing Bugs:
Challenge: Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Strategy: Use systematic debugging tools, write clean and maintainable code, and conduct thorough testing during development.

Keeping Up with New Technologies:
Challenge: Rapid technological advancements can make it hard to stay updated.
